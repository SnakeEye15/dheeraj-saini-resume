# Dheeraj Saini - Dynamic Automation Engineer Resume 🚀

This repository hosts the source code for the interactive, single-page resume of Dheeraj Saini, an experienced Software Engineer specializing in Automation and SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test).

The resume is designed as a modern, dark-themed web application to showcase technical skills and career achievements in a visually engaging way, moving beyond a traditional static PDF.

## ✨ Features

* **Dark Mode Aesthetic:** A modern, high-contrast dark theme (Deep Space Blue/Black) for a sophisticated, tech-focused look.
* **Dynamic Animations (AOS):** Utilizes the Animate On Scroll (AOS) library for smooth, staggered content loading as the user scrolls, creating an interactive feel.
* **Typewriter Effect:** An engaging CSS animation on the main professional title for a memorable first impression.
* **"Hacker Terminal" Key Metric:** A visually striking, glowing card highlights the primary achievement of **40% reduction in manual testing**.
* **Vertical Timeline:** The professional experience section uses a clean, vertically-aligned timeline to clearly map out job roles and responsibilities.
* **Scroll-Spy Navigation:** A sticky navigation bar that automatically highlights the active section as the user scrolls down the page.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built using foundational web technologies with modern tooling:

* **HTML5:** Structure and content.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive styling.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Used for scroll-spy functionality and smooth navigation.
* **AOS (Animate On Scroll):** Library for declarative scroll-based animations.

## 💡 Customization

The design is built entirely with Tailwind CSS utilities and a few custom CSS classes.

* **Colors:** Modify the color variables (e.g., `#58a6ff` for the accent blue) in the main `<style>` block to change the primary theme color.
* **Content:** All text content is in the main HTML file. Update the text fields in the `Profile`, `Skills`, `Experience`, and `Education` sections.
* **Animations:** The entrance animations are controlled by `data-aos="..."` attributes directly on the HTML elements. You can change `fade-right`, `zoom-in`, etc., or adjust the `data-aos-delay` to change the timing.
